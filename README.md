# SBA_API
# This web appilcation gives users a random recipe based off a specific dietary restriction they have. I used edamam API for the different recipes
# For this sba I built out this application a little more by showing more reciptes with pictures and adding them to a gallery of sorts. I used pagination so users could scroll through the different recipes by type. I also updraged the functions to async functions.
